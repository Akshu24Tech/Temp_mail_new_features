                <h2 class="section-title">The Tech behind Disposable Email Addresses</h2>
                
                <div class="tech-content">
                    <p>Everyone owns an email address each and every hour, for everything from connecting at work, with business prospects, reaching out to friends and colleagues using the email address as an online passport. Nearly 99% of all apps and services we sign-up today required an email address, likewise to most shoppers loyalty cards, contest and offer entries, and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>We all enjoy having an email address, but getting tons of spam emails each day doesn't feel comfortable. Furthermore, it's entirely common for stores to have their databases hacked, leaving your business email address at risk and more likely to end up on spam lists. Still, nothing done online is 100% private. Thus you need to protect your email contact identity and best done using disposable emails address.</p>
                    
                    <h3>So, What Is A Disposable Email Address?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Recently, I found a bounce rate complex than usual on my latest email blast! I later realized the surge of users (or bots) signing up for my services hiding their real identity using disposable mail addresses.</p>
                    
                    <p>Disposable email address (DEA) technically means an approach where a user's with a unique email address gets a temporary email address for your current contact. The DEA allow the creation of an email address that passes validity need to sign-up for services and website without having to show your true identity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Disposable emails address if compromised or used in connection with email abuse online, the owner can't be tied to the abuse and quickly cancel its application without affecting other contacts. With temporary mail, you can you receive your emails from the fake emails in your genuine emails address for a specified time set. The fake email address is simply a through-away email, temporary email set and self-destructs email.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why would you need a fake email address?</h3>
                    
                    <p>You must have noted services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix allow limited-time test runs(trials), however, if still determined to use the services all you need is a disposable email address. Technically, you can extend your trial usage using a different email address linked to your original (genuine) after the trial period expires.</p>
                    
                    <p>An offline or online retailer tend to demand an email address to take advantage of their offers, however, this result in an unwanted deluge of spam promotional emails that you could avoid. Temporary email address makes it easy to cut out those irritating messages you are still receiving.</p>
                    
                    <p>Technically, the idea of a temporary email address conjures up with black hat hackers and underworld internet, but there are convincing reason to us fake email services.</p>
